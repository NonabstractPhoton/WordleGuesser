# WordleGuesser

A simple console program that can be used to solve any Wordle which has a solution among the possible answers for the official New York Times Wordle game.  

Adding words to PossibleWords.txt will expand the scope of the algorithm if one so chooses, however, that would reduce its efficiency as a pure Worlde/Wordle Clone solver, and so the choice is left to the user.
