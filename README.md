# WordleGuesser

A simple console program that can be used to solve any Wordle that has a solution among the possible answers for the official New York Times Wordle game. Must be opened in Visual Studio if the user does not want to manually edit the directory location.  

Adding words to PossibleWords.txt will expand the scope of the algorithm if one so chooses, however, that would reduce its efficiency as a pure Worlde/Wordle Clone solver, and so the choice is left to the user.
