A simple console program that can be used to solve any Wordle whos solution is among the possible answers for the official New York Times Wordle game. The user experience is overall clunky since I made this quickly for personal use, but it's fun to mess around with,  

Adding words to PossibleWords.txt will expand the scope of the algorithm if one so chooses, however that would reduce its effeciency as a pure Worlde/Wordle Clone solver, so do as you will.
